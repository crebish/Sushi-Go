Terminal based imitation of real-life card game "Sushi-Go"

The goal of this three player game is to select cards and  
end the game with the most points. Each card contributes to 
the point count differently.

Each player is dealt nine cards and chooses one from their hand
and reveals it to the rest of the player. The hand is then passed
to the person on the right and this repeats until all cards are
chosen. Points are then tallied. 3 rounds are played.

Tempura: If a player has 2 tempura they recieve 5 points. 
         1 tempura does not affect their score.
         
Sashimi: If a player has 3 sashimi they recieve 10 points. 
         1 or 2 sashimi does not affect their score.

Dumpling: 1 Dumpling = 1 Point
          2 Dumplings = 3 Points
          3 Dumplings = 6 Points
          4 Dumplings = 10 Points
          5+ Dumplings = 15 Points

Nigiri: 3 different types of nigiri: Egg(1 Point), Salmon(2), Squid(3)

Wasabi: If the player has a wasabi in their hand and picks a nigiri,
        the score of the nigiri is tripled

Maki: Maki cards can have between 1 and 3 makis in it. The person with
      the most makis at the end of the round gets 6 points, second 3.
      Points are distributed evenly if there are ties.

Pudding: At the end of the game the total pudding of each player is 
         tallied. The player with the most gains 6 points, least loses
         6 points. Points are distributed evenly in the event of a tie.

Chopsticks (Not Implemented): Allows a player to select 2 cards their 
                              next turn.
